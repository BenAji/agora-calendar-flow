# âœ… DEVELOPMENT PLAN â€” AgoraCalendar Outlook Add-in

This document defines the **strict development plan** for the AgoraCalendar project.  
All developers and AI coding agents (including Cursor AI) **must follow this plan exactly**.

- Microsoft Graph API (Calendar Access & Conflict Detection)
- Papaparse (CSV Upload/Export)
- Recharts or Chart.js (Analytics Dashboards)
- React Router (Role-Based Routing)

---

## âœ… DEVELOPMENT RULE:
> **Every implementation must follow this document and the approved mockup exactly. No deviations, substitutions, or redesigns are allowed unless explicitly approved by the product owner.**

## âœ… FIRST DEVELOPMENT STEP:
1. Scaffold project with React, TailwindCSS, Office.js, MSAL, React Router.
2. Implement:
